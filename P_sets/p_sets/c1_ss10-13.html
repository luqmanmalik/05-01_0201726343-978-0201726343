						There are four roads connecting towns A and B, and three roads from B to C. So, by the rule of product, there are $4\cdot3=12$ roads from A to C passing through B. Since there are two direct roads from A to C, there are $12+2=14$ destinct ways in which Linda can travel to C from A. $\square$
					</li>
					<li>
						For each of these fourteen paths, Linda may select again (from the same pool of paths) to complete a round trip. Hence, by the rule of product, we find there are $14\cdot14=196$ distinct round trips from A to C and back again. $\square$
					</li>
					<li>
						In this case, Linda has 14 options to get from A to C. For her return trip, however, she has all but that combination available to her. So there are $14\cdot13=182$ possible round trips in this scenario. $\square$
