				While on a Saturday shopping spree, Jennifer and Tiffany witnessed two men driving away from the front of a jewelry shop, just before a burglar alarm started to sound. Although everything happend rather quickly, when the two young ladies were questioned they were able to give the police the following information about the license plate (which consisted of two letters followed by four digits) on the get&ndash;away car. Tiffany was sure that the second letter on the plate was either an O or a Q and the last digit was either a 3 or an 8. Jennifer told the investigator that the first letter on the plate was either a C or a G and that the first digit was definitely a 7. How many different license plates will the police have to check out?
