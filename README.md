## Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction
### Fifth Edition Problem Sets &#9634; Ralph P. Grimaldi
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

A decent stack of work in combinatorics is indespensible to the contemporary track in pure mathematics. Sufice it to say that Grimaldi is no climb for the faint–hearted. **Finite state machines**, **automata theory**, and the **p–adic numbers** are topics I will be exploring more closely as I progress through the book. Later on, I will be looking for ways to integrate this work with a library on Libkin's _Elements of Finite Model Theory_.

__Specifications()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. The Hilix Standard page frame is a tenth–order quaternion prismplex with nine closed (dynamic) fields. It may also be described as a partial frame, meaning that ¬(every closed field has slide and scroll fucntionality) in contrast to a complete fraim, where every closed field has slide and scroll functionality. The frames memory is accesible through conventional menus and search. Far less conventionally, each slide has an autonomous search engine which remains loaded in the RAM while sliding through pages. The library is licensed for use under the terms in the file <code>MIT_License</code>.
