## Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction
### Fifth Edition Problem Sets &#9634; Ralph P. Grimaldi
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

A decent stack of work in combinatorics is indesensible to the contemporary track in pure mathematics. Sufice it to say that Grimaldi is no climb for the faint–hearted. **Finite state machines** and **automata theory** are topics I will be exploring more closely as I pregress through the book.

Copyrighting dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone a/o fork of each version of the source, a well–defined copyright ecology is formed within the repository's historical record. Furthermore, by compiling the metadata of each version>clone>fork, one can analize the structural distance of that copy from the source. Therefore, [repo + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::autr(s_code).
