These are my solutions to the text. That is to say, what is written here I have written myself.

**Finite state machines** | **automata**

Copyrighting dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone a/o fork of each version of the source, a well–defined copyright ecology is formed within the repository's historical record. Furthermore, by compiling the unique metadata of each version>clone>fork its structural distance from the source can be measured and evaluated. Therefore, [local_contribut_data + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::S_code(author).
