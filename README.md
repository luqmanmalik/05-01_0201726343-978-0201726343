## Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction
### Fifth Edition Problem Sets &#9634; Ralph P. Grimaldi
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

A decent stack of work in combinatorics is indespensible to the contemporary track in pure mathematics. Sufice it to say that Grimaldi is no climb for the faint–hearted. **Finite state machines**, **automata theory**, and the **p–adic numbers** are topics I will be exploring more closely as I progress through the book. Later on, I will be looking for ways to integrate this work with a repository on finite model theory.

__Required tech()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal structure seems excessive and idyllic at this stage.
