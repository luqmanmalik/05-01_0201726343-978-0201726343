A decent stack of work in combinatorics is indespensible to the contemporary track in pure mathematics. Sufice it to say that Grimaldi is no climb for the faint–hearted. **Finite state machines**, **automata theory**, and the **p–adic numbers** are topics I will be exploring more closely as I progress through the book. Later on, I will be looking for ways to integrate this work with a library on Libkin's _Elements of Finite Model Theory_.

__Specifications()__ This repository is Safari–centric and designed on a 13" MacBook running OS X El Capitan. The Hilix Standard page frame is an eleventh–order quaternion prismplex with eight closed (dynamic) fields. It may also be described as a partial frame, meaning that ¬(every closed field has slide and scroll fucntionality) in contrast to a complete frame, where every closed field has slide and scroll functionality. The frame's memory is accesible through conventional menus and search. Far less conventionally, each slide has an autonomous search engine, whose query returns remain loaded in the RAM while sliding through pages. The library is licensed for use under the terms in the file <code>MIT_License</code>.
