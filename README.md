## Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics: An Applied Introduction
### Fifth Edition Problem Sets &#9634; Ralph P. Grimaldi
#### Solutions by Luqman Malik

A decent stack of work in combinatorics is indesensible to the contemporary track in pure mathematics. Sufice it to say that Grimaldi is no climb for the faint–hearted. **Finite state machines**, **automata theory**, and the **p–adic numbers** are topics I will be exploring more closely as I pregress through the book. Later on, I will be looking for ways to integrate this work with a repository on finite model theory.

__Required tech()__ All of my repositories are Safari–centric. Given the simplex design of the page–frame (HTML_CSS, MathJax) versus the complex embedding of the carousel<sup>4</sup> main–frame (JS, PHP, c++), a browser–universal repository seems exessive and idyllic at this stage.

**Copyrighting** dynamic arrangements of digitized mathematical content seems intuitively paradoxical and superfluous, but – in fact, the inverse can immediately be shown to be true. By embedding the appropriate [license file](https://choosealicense.com "OSL") in each clone and_or fork of each version of the source, a well–defined attribution ecology is formed within the repository's geneological record. Furthermore, by compiling the metadata of each version>clone>fork, one can analize the structural distance of that copy from the source. Therefore, [repo + metadata(repo) + License]::**authenticate**::autr(s_code).
